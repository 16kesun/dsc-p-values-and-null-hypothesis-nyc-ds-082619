    "### Understanding  The Null Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said previously, scientific experiments actually have 2 hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Null Hypothesis_**: There is no relationship between A and B \n",
    "Example: \"There is no relationship between this flu medication and a reduced recovery time from the flu\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Alternative Hypothesis_**: The hypothesis we traditionally think of when thikning of a hypothesis for an experiment\n",
    "Example: \"This flu medication reduces recovery time for the flu.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Does an Experiment Really Prove?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists use the Null Hypothesis so that we can be very specific in our findings. This is because a successful experiment doesn't actually _prove a relationship_ between our dependent and independent variable.  Instead, it just proves that we do not have enough evidence to convincingly believe there is _no relationship_ between the dependent and the independent variable. There can always be a lurking variable behind the scenes that is actually responsible for the relationship between our two variables--its almost impossible to cover every possible angle. However, a successful experiment where our p-value is less than our alpha value (typically, $p < 0.05$) does give us enough information to confidently say that's statistically unlikely that there is _no relationship_ between the two, which is what would have to be true in order for the null hypothesis to be correct!\n",

    "Read the following article, [The Null Hypothesis Loves You and Wants You To Be Happy](https://byrslf.co/the-null-hypothesis-loves-you-and-wants-you-to-be-happy-3189413d8cd0).  This does an excellent job of explaining why the concept of the _Null Hypothesis_ is crucial to good science.  \n",
