# P-Values and the Null Hypothesis


## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll learn about the relationship between P-values and the Null Hypothesis, and their role in designing an experiment. 


## Objectives

You will be able to:

* Understand and explain the null hypothesis, including its role in sound experiment design
* Understand, calculate, and interpret P-values


## Understanding  The Null Hypothesis

As we said previously, scientific experiments actually have 2 hypotheses:

**_Null Hypothesis_**: There is no relationship between A and B 
Example: "There is no relationship between this flu medication and a reduced recovery time from the flu"

**_Alternative Hypothesis_**: The hypothesis we traditionally think of when thikning of a hypothesis for an experiment
Example: "This flu medication reduces recovery time for the flu."

### What Does an Experiment Really Prove?

Scientists use the Null Hypothesis so that we can be very specific in our findings. This is because a successful experiment doesn't actually _prove a relationship_ between our dependent and independent variable.  Instead, it just proves that we do not have enough evidence to convincingly believe there is _no relationship_ between the dependent and the independent variable. There can always be a lurking variable behind the scenes that is actually responsible for the relationship between our two variables--its almost impossible to cover every possible angle. However, a successful experiment where our p-value is less than our alpha value (typically, $p < 0.05$) does give us enough information to confidently say that's statistically unlikely that there is _no relationship_ between the two, which is what would have to be true in order for the null hypothesis to be correct!

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the relationship between P-values and the Null Hypothesis. Now let's move on and see how group sizes affect our tests!
